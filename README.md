Python-settings-compare-tool
===================================

Takes 2 Device Settings Reports and compares them.  If any differences are found, a text file with the differences is created.

This script must be ran from the same directory as the Device Settings Reports.  It will not work properly if ran from another directory!!!

This script requires 2 Device Settings reports to compare. (Preferably, one from the startup and one from a later time)

This script requires that Python be installed on the machine where the comparison is taking place.  Python can be found here: <http://www.python.org>

This script should be compatible accross multiple platforms as it was written in python using standard libraries, however, it was only tesed on Windows.
